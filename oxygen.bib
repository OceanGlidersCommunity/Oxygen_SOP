abstract = {The time response behavior of Aanderaa optodes model 3830, 4330, and 4330F, as well as a Sea-Bird SBE63 optode and a JFE Alec Co. Rinko dissolved oxygen sensor was analyzed both in the laboratory and in the field. The main factor for the time response is the dynamic regime, i.e., the water flow around the sensor that influences the boundary layer's dynamics. Response times can be drastically reduced if the sensors are pumped. Laboratory experiments under different dynamic conditions showed a close to linear relation between response time and temperature. Application of a diffusion model including a stagnant boundary layer revealed that molecular diffusion determines the temperature behavior, and that the boundary layer thickness was temperature independent. Moreover, field experiments matched the laboratory findings, with the profiling speed and mode of attachment being of prime importance. The time response was characterized for typical deployments on shipboard CTDs, gliders, and floats, and tools are presented to predict the response time as well as to quantify the effect on the data for a given water mass profile. Finally, the problem of inverse filtering optode data to recover some of the information lost by their time response is addressed.},

abstract = {Equations and tables are presented from which accurate values can be obtained, in any of several sets of units, for the concentration of oxygen dissolved in freshwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere from 0° to 40°C and 0.5 to 1.1 atm. The y are based on values for the Henry coefficient of oxygen, ko, which have an estimated accuracy of 0.02\%. Equations are derived which relate ko to equilibrium concentrations in natural waters. The equations include corrections for molecular interactions in the vapor phase. Uncertainty about the best way to correct for these interactions limits the estimated accurracy of the derived values to about ± 0.07\% at 0°C and 0.04\% at 40°C, but the new results are much more accurate than values from the UNESCO tables. Within their random errors, previous measurements agree very well with the new results. Under equilibrium conditions, and between 0° and 60°C, the per mil difference between the 34O2:32O2 abundance ratio in the dissolved gas and the air is given by δ = −0.730 + (427/T), where T is in kelvin and the standard deviation is <0.02‰.},
