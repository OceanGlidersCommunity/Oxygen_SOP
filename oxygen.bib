abstract = {Abstract An Aanderaa Data Instruments 4831 oxygen optode was configured on an underwater glider such that the optode extended into the atmosphere during each glider surface interval enabling in situ calibration of the sensor by directly measuring the known oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere. The approach, which has previously been implemented on profiling floats but not on gliders, was tested during a 15-d deployment at the New England shelf break in June 2016, a productive period during which surface O2 saturation averaged 110\%. Results were validated by shipboard Winkler O2 calibration casts, which were used to determine a sensor gain factor of 1.055 ± 0.004. Consistent with profiling float observations, air measurements contain contamination from splashing water and/or residual seawater on the sensor face. Glider surface measurements were determined to be a linear combination of 36\% of surface water and 64\% atmospheric air. When correcting air measurements for this effect, a sensor gain correction of 1.055 ± 0.005 was calculated based on comparing glider air measurements to the expected atmospheric pO2 calculated from atmospheric pressure and humidity data from a nearby NOAA buoy. Thus, the two approaches were in agreement and were both demonstrated to be accurate to within ±0.5\%. We expect uncertainty in the air-calibration could be further reduced by increasing the vertical positioning of the optode, lengthening deployment time, or operating in waters with surface O2 saturation closer to equilibrium.},

abstract = {Abstract Studies of the impact of hypoxic or anoxic environments on both climate and ecosystems rely on a detailed characterization of the oxygen (O2) distribution along the water column. The former trivial separation between oxic and anoxic conditions is now often redefined as a blurry concentration range in which both aerobic and anaerobic processes might coexist, both in situ and during experimental incubations. The O2 concentrations during such incubations have often been assumed to be equal to in situ levels, but the concentration was rarely measured. In order to evaluate the actual oxygen concentration in samples collected from low-oxygen environments, a series of measurements were performed on samples collected in the Pacific oxygen minimum zones. Our results show a significant deviation from in situ anoxic conditions in samples collected by Niskin bottles where leakage from the bottle material resulted in O2 concentrations of up to 1 μM. Subsequent sampling further increased the O2 contamination. Sampling and analysis by Winkler method resulted in variable apparent concentrations of 2–4 μM. Two common procedures to avoid atmospheric contamination were also tested: allowing gentle overflow and keeping the sampling bottle submersed in a portion of the sampled water. Both procedures resulted in similar O2 contamination with values of 0.5–1.5 μM when bottles were immediately closed and measurements performed with optical sensors, and 3–4 μM apparent concentration when analyzed by the Winkler method. Winkler titration is thus not suited for analysis of low-O2 samples. It can be concluded that incubation under anoxic conditions requires deoxygenation after conventional sampling.}

abstract = {Abstract At suboxic oxygen concentrations, key biogeochemical cycles change and denitrification becomes the dominant remineralization pathway. Earth system models predict oxygen loss across most ocean basins in the next century; oxygen minimum zones near suboxia may become suboxic and therefore denitrifying. Using an ocean glider survey and historical data, we show oxygen loss in the Gulf of Oman (from 6–12 to <2 μmol kg−1) not represented in climatologies. Because of the nonlinearity between denitrification and oxygen concentration, resolutions of current Earth system models are too coarse to accurately estimate denitrification. We develop a novel physical proxy for oxygen from the glider data and use a high-resolution physical model to show eddy stirring of oxygen across the Gulf of Oman. We use the model to investigate spatial and seasonal differences in the ratio of oxic and suboxic water across the Gulf of Oman and waters exported to the wider Arabian Sea.},

Rinko dissolved oxygen sensor was analyzed both in the laboratory and in the field. The main factor for the time response is the dynamic regime, i.e., the water flow around the sensor that influences the boundary layer's dynamics. Response times can be drastically reduced if the sensors are pumped. Laboratory experiments under different dynamic conditions showed a close to linear relation between response time and temperature. Application of a diffusion model including a stagnant boundary layer revealed that molecular diffusion determines the temperature behavior, and that the boundary layer thickness was temperature independent. Moreover, field experiments matched the laboratory findings, with the profiling speed and mode of attachment being of prime importance. The time response was characterized for typical deployments on shipboard CTDs, gliders, and floats, and tools are presented to predict the response time as well as to quantify the effect on the data for a given water mass profile. Finally, the problem of inverse filtering optode data to recover some of the information lost by their time response is addressed.},

The y are based on values for the Henry coefficient of oxygen, ko, which have an estimated accuracy of 0.02\%. Equations are derived which relate ko to equilibrium concentrations in natural waters. The equations include corrections for molecular interactions in the vapor phase. Uncertainty about the best way to correct for these interactions limits the estimated accurracy of the derived values to about ± 0.07\% at 0°C and 0.04\% at 40°C, but the new results are much more accurate than values from the UNESCO tables. Within their random errors, previous measurements agree very well with the new results. Under equilibrium conditions, and between 0° and 60°C, the per mil difference between the 34O2:32O2 abundance ratio in the dissolved gas and the air is given by δ = −0.730 + (427/T), where T is in kelvin and the standard deviation is <0.02‰.},

ABSTRACT = {Water monitoring sensors in industrial, municipal and environmental monitoring are advancing our understanding of science, aid developments in process automatization and control and support real-time decisions in emergency situations. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, increasingly specialized and diversified and cheaper. Advanced deployment platforms now exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. For a large percentage of submersed instrumentation, biofouling is the single biggest factor affecting the operation, maintenance and data quality. This increases the cost of ownership to the extent that it is prohibitive to maintain operational sensor networks and infrastructures. In this context, the paper provides a brief overview of biofouling, including the development and properties of biofilms. The state-of-the-art established and emerging antifouling strategies are reviewed and discussed. A summary of the currently implemented solutions in commercially available sensors is provided and current trends are discussed. Finally, the limitations of the currently used solutions are reviewed, and future research and development directions are highlighted.},

abstract = {Abstract The formation of a subsurface anticyclonic eddy in the Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) in January and February 2013 is investigated using a multiplatform four-dimensional observational approach. Research vessel, multiple glider, and mooring-based measurements were conducted in the Peruvian upwelling regime near 12°30'S. The data set consists of >10,000 glider profiles and repeated vessel-based hydrography and velocity transects. It allows a detailed description of the eddy formation and its impact on the near-coastal salinity, oxygen, and nutrient distributions. In early January, a strong PCUC with maximum poleward velocities of ∼0.25 m/s at 100–200 m depth was observed. Starting on 20 January, a subsurface anticyclonic eddy developed in the PCUC downstream of a topographic bend, suggesting flow separation as the eddy formation mechanism. The eddy core waters exhibited oxygen concentration of <1 μmol/kg, an elevated nitrogen deficit of ∼17 μmol/L, and potential vorticity close to zero, which seemed to originate from the bottom boundary layer of the continental slope. The eddy-induced across-shelf velocities resulted in an elevated exchange of water masses between the upper continental slope and the open ocean. Small-scale salinity and oxygen structures were formed by along-isopycnal stirring, and indications of eddy-driven oxygen ventilation of the upper oxygen minimum zone were observed. It is concluded that mesoscale stirring of solutes and the offshore transport of eddy core properties could provide an important coastal open ocean exchange mechanism with potentially large implications for nutrient budgets and biogeochemical cycling in the oxygen minimum zone off Peru.},

The electrochemical STOX O2 sensor contains a primary sensing cathode and a secondary cathode that, when polarized, prevents entry of O2 into the sensor. This arrangement enables frequent in situ zero calibration and confers the sensor with a detection limit of 1-10 nmol L−1 O2, even during application on a Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) profiler at great water depths. The sensor was used during the Galathea 3 Expedition to demonstrate that the core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off Peru contained < 2 nM O2. Application in a reactor on board demonstrated that changes in O2 concentrations in OMZ water containing < 200 nmol L−1 O2 could be monitored over periods of hours to days. The linear decrease in O2 concentration in the reactor indicated very low (< 20 nmol L−1) half saturation constants for the O2 respiring microbial community.},

ABSTRACT={The Biogeochemical-Argo program (BGC-Argo) is a new profiling-float-based, ocean wide, and distributed ocean monitoring program which is tightly linked to, and has benefited significantly from, the Argo program. The community has recommended for BGC-Argo to measure six additional properties in addition to pressure, temperature and salinity measured by Argo, to include oxygen, pH, nitrate, downwelling light, chlorophyll fluorescence and the optical backscattering coefficient. The purpose of this addition is to enable the monitoring of ocean biogeochemistry and health, and in particular, monitor major processes such as ocean deoxygenation, acidification and warming and their effect on phytoplankton, the main source of energy of marine ecosystems. Here we describe the salient issues associated with the operation of the BGC-Argo network, with information useful for those interested in deploying floats and using the data they produce. The topics include float testing, deployment and increasingly, recovery. Aspects of data management, processing and quality control are covered as well as specific issues associated with each of the six BGC-Argo sensors. In particular, it is recommended that water samples be collected during float deployment to be used for validation of sensor output.}

ABSTRACT={From 2008 to 2019, a comprehensive research project, ‘SFB 754, Climate – Biogeochemistry Interactions in the Tropical Ocean,’ was funded by the German Research Foundation to investigate the climate-biogeochemistry interactions in the tropical ocean with a particular emphasis on the processes determining the oxygen distribution. During three 4-year long funding phases, a consortium of more than 150 scientists conducted or participated in 34 major research cruises and collected a wealth of physical, biological, chemical, and meteorological data. A common data policy agreed upon at the initiation of the project provided the basis for the open publication of all data. Here we provide an inventory of this unique data set and briefly summarize the various data acquisition and processing methods used.}
