abstract = {Abstract An Aanderaa Data Instruments 4831 oxygen optode was configured on an underwater glider such that the optode extended into the atmosphere during each glider surface interval enabling in situ calibration of the sensor by directly measuring the known oxygen partial pressure of the atmosphere. The approach, which has previously been implemented on profiling floats but not on gliders, was tested during a 15-d deployment at the New England shelf break in June 2016, a productive period during which surface O2 saturation averaged 110\%. Results were validated by shipboard Winkler O2 calibration casts, which were used to determine a sensor gain factor of 1.055 ± 0.004. Consistent with profiling float observations, air measurements contain contamination from splashing water and/or residual seawater on the sensor face. Glider surface measurements were determined to be a linear combination of 36\% of surface water and 64\% atmospheric air. When correcting air measurements for this effect, a sensor gain correction of 1.055 ± 0.005 was calculated based on comparing glider air measurements to the expected atmospheric pO2 calculated from atmospheric pressure and humidity data from a nearby NOAA buoy. Thus, the two approaches were in agreement and were both demonstrated to be accurate to within ±0.5\%. We expect uncertainty in the air-calibration could be further reduced by increasing the vertical positioning of the optode, lengthening deployment time, or operating in waters with surface O2 saturation closer to equilibrium.},

abstract = {Abstract At suboxic oxygen concentrations, key biogeochemical cycles change and denitrification becomes the dominant remineralization pathway. Earth system models predict oxygen loss across most ocean basins in the next century; oxygen minimum zones near suboxia may become suboxic and therefore denitrifying. Using an ocean glider survey and historical data, we show oxygen loss in the Gulf of Oman (from 6–12 to <2 μmol kg−1) not represented in climatologies. Because of the nonlinearity between denitrification and oxygen concentration, resolutions of current Earth system models are too coarse to accurately estimate denitrification. We develop a novel physical proxy for oxygen from the glider data and use a high-resolution physical model to show eddy stirring of oxygen across the Gulf of Oman. We use the model to investigate spatial and seasonal differences in the ratio of oxic and suboxic water across the Gulf of Oman and waters exported to the wider Arabian Sea.},

abstract = {The time response behavior of Aanderaa optodes model 3830, 4330, and 4330F, as well as a Sea-Bird SBE63 optode and a JFE Alec Co. Rinko dissolved oxygen sensor was analyzed both in the laboratory and in the field. The main factor for the time response is the dynamic regime, i.e., the water flow around the sensor that influences the boundary layer's dynamics. Response times can be drastically reduced if the sensors are pumped. Laboratory experiments under different dynamic conditions showed a close to linear relation between response time and temperature. Application of a diffusion model including a stagnant boundary layer revealed that molecular diffusion determines the temperature behavior, and that the boundary layer thickness was temperature independent. Moreover, field experiments matched the laboratory findings, with the profiling speed and mode of attachment being of prime importance. The time response was characterized for typical deployments on shipboard CTDs, gliders, and floats, and tools are presented to predict the response time as well as to quantify the effect on the data for a given water mass profile. Finally, the problem of inverse filtering optode data to recover some of the information lost by their time response is addressed.},

abstract = {Equations and tables are presented from which accurate values can be obtained, in any of several sets of units, for the concentration of oxygen dissolved in freshwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere from 0° to 40°C and 0.5 to 1.1 atm. The y are based on values for the Henry coefficient of oxygen, ko, which have an estimated accuracy of 0.02\%. Equations are derived which relate ko to equilibrium concentrations in natural waters. The equations include corrections for molecular interactions in the vapor phase. Uncertainty about the best way to correct for these interactions limits the estimated accurracy of the derived values to about ± 0.07\% at 0°C and 0.04\% at 40°C, but the new results are much more accurate than values from the UNESCO tables. Within their random errors, previous measurements agree very well with the new results. Under equilibrium conditions, and between 0° and 60°C, the per mil difference between the 34O2:32O2 abundance ratio in the dissolved gas and the air is given by δ = −0.730 + (427/T), where T is in kelvin and the standard deviation is <0.02‰.},

Such systems take advantage of existing superstructures such as offshore platforms, lightships, piers, breakwaters or are placed on specially designed buoys or deep sea fix stations. The major goal of these equipments is to provide in real time reliable measurements without costly frequent maintenance. These autonomous monitoring systems are affected by a well-known phenomenon in seawater condition, called biofouling. Consequently, such systems without efficient biofouling protection are hopeless. This protection must be applied to the sensors and to the underwater communication equipments based on acoustic technologies. This paper presents the results obtained in laboratory and at sea, with various instruments, protected by a localised chlorine generation system. Two other major protection techniques, wipers and copper shutters, are presented as well.",

ABSTRACT = {Water monitoring sensors in industrial, municipal and environmental monitoring are advancing our understanding of science, aid developments in process automatization and control and support real-time decisions in emergency situations. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, increasingly specialized and diversified and cheaper. Advanced deployment platforms now exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. For a large percentage of submersed instrumentation, biofouling is the single biggest factor affecting the operation, maintenance and data quality. This increases the cost of ownership to the extent that it is prohibitive to maintain operational sensor networks and infrastructures. In this context, the paper provides a brief overview of biofouling, including the development and properties of biofilms. The state-of-the-art established and emerging antifouling strategies are reviewed and discussed. A summary of the currently implemented solutions in commercially available sensors is provided and current trends are discussed. Finally, the limitations of the currently used solutions are reviewed, and future research and development directions are highlighted.},

abstract = {Abstract The formation of a subsurface anticyclonic eddy in the Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) in January and February 2013 is investigated using a multiplatform four-dimensional observational approach. Research vessel, multiple glider, and mooring-based measurements were conducted in the Peruvian upwelling regime near 12°30'S. The data set consists of >10,000 glider profiles and repeated vessel-based hydrography and velocity transects. It allows a detailed description of the eddy formation and its impact on the near-coastal salinity, oxygen, and nutrient distributions. In early January, a strong PCUC with maximum poleward velocities of ∼0.25 m/s at 100–200 m depth was observed. Starting on 20 January, a subsurface anticyclonic eddy developed in the PCUC downstream of a topographic bend, suggesting flow separation as the eddy formation mechanism. The eddy core waters exhibited oxygen concentration of <1 μmol/kg, an elevated nitrogen deficit of ∼17 μmol/L, and potential vorticity close to zero, which seemed to originate from the bottom boundary layer of the continental slope. The eddy-induced across-shelf velocities resulted in an elevated exchange of water masses between the upper continental slope and the open ocean. Small-scale salinity and oxygen structures were formed by along-isopycnal stirring, and indications of eddy-driven oxygen ventilation of the upper oxygen minimum zone were observed. It is concluded that mesoscale stirring of solutes and the offshore transport of eddy core properties could provide an important coastal open ocean exchange mechanism with potentially large implications for nutrient budgets and biogeochemical cycling in the oxygen minimum zone off Peru.},

abstract = {The methods used until now have not been able to reliably resolve O2 concentrations in oceanic oxygen minimum zones below 1–2 µmol L−1. We present a new amperometric sensor for the determination of ultra-low O2 concentrations under in situ conditions. The electrochemical STOX O2 sensor contains a primary sensing cathode and a secondary cathode that, when polarized, prevents entry of O2 into the sensor. This arrangement enables frequent in situ zero calibration and confers the sensor with a detection limit of 1-10 nmol L−1 O2, even during application on a Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) profiler at great water depths. The sensor was used during the Galathea 3 Expedition to demonstrate that the core of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) off Peru contained < 2 nM O2. Application in a reactor on board demonstrated that changes in O2 concentrations in OMZ water containing < 200 nmol L−1 O2 could be monitored over periods of hours to days. The linear decrease in O2 concentration in the reactor indicated very low (< 20 nmol L−1) half saturation constants for the O2 respiring microbial community.},
