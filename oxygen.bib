abstract = {The time response behavior of Aanderaa optodes model 3830, 4330, and 4330F, as well as a Sea-Bird SBE63 optode and a JFE Alec Co. Rinko dissolved oxygen sensor was analyzed both in the laboratory and in the field. The main factor for the time response is the dynamic regime, i.e., the water flow around the sensor that influences the boundary layer's dynamics. Response times can be drastically reduced if the sensors are pumped. Laboratory experiments under different dynamic conditions showed a close to linear relation between response time and temperature. Application of a diffusion model including a stagnant boundary layer revealed that molecular diffusion determines the temperature behavior, and that the boundary layer thickness was temperature independent. Moreover, field experiments matched the laboratory findings, with the profiling speed and mode of attachment being of prime importance. The time response was characterized for typical deployments on shipboard CTDs, gliders, and floats, and tools are presented to predict the response time as well as to quantify the effect on the data for a given water mass profile. Finally, the problem of inverse filtering optode data to recover some of the information lost by their time response is addressed.},

abstract = {Equations and tables are presented from which accurate values can be obtained, in any of several sets of units, for the concentration of oxygen dissolved in freshwater in equilibrium with the atmosphere from 0° to 40°C and 0.5 to 1.1 atm. The y are based on values for the Henry coefficient of oxygen, ko, which have an estimated accuracy of 0.02\%. Equations are derived which relate ko to equilibrium concentrations in natural waters. The equations include corrections for molecular interactions in the vapor phase. Uncertainty about the best way to correct for these interactions limits the estimated accurracy of the derived values to about ± 0.07\% at 0°C and 0.04\% at 40°C, but the new results are much more accurate than values from the UNESCO tables. Within their random errors, previous measurements agree very well with the new results. Under equilibrium conditions, and between 0° and 60°C, the per mil difference between the 34O2:32O2 abundance ratio in the dissolved gas and the air is given by δ = −0.730 + (427/T), where T is in kelvin and the standard deviation is <0.02‰.},

abstract="These days, many marine autonomous environment monitoring networks are set up in the world. Such systems take advantage of existing superstructures such as offshore platforms, lightships, piers, breakwaters or are placed on specially designed buoys or deep sea fix stations. The major goal of these equipments is to provide in real time reliable measurements without costly frequent maintenance. These autonomous monitoring systems are affected by a well-known phenomenon in seawater condition, called biofouling. Consequently, such systems without efficient biofouling protection are hopeless. This protection must be applied to the sensors and to the underwater communication equipments based on acoustic technologies. This paper presents the results obtained in laboratory and at sea, with various instruments, protected by a localised chlorine generation system. Two other major protection techniques, wipers and copper shutters, are presented as well.",

ABSTRACT = {Water monitoring sensors in industrial, municipal and environmental monitoring are advancing our understanding of science, aid developments in process automatization and control and support real-time decisions in emergency situations. Sensors are becoming smaller, smarter, increasingly specialized and diversified and cheaper. Advanced deployment platforms now exist to support various monitoring needs together with state-of-the-art power and communication capabilities. For a large percentage of submersed instrumentation, biofouling is the single biggest factor affecting the operation, maintenance and data quality. This increases the cost of ownership to the extent that it is prohibitive to maintain operational sensor networks and infrastructures. In this context, the paper provides a brief overview of biofouling, including the development and properties of biofilms. The state-of-the-art established and emerging antifouling strategies are reviewed and discussed. A summary of the currently implemented solutions in commercially available sensors is provided and current trends are discussed. Finally, the limitations of the currently used solutions are reviewed, and future research and development directions are highlighted.},
