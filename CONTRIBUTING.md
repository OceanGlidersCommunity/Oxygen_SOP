## How we make decisions on relevant content changes?

Every issue will be reviewed at least one of the lead authors. 
They have the authority to decide whether the issues is a minor or major change. 
Minor changes can be accepted directly after one review of the lead authors. 
Major changes requires at least 3 reviews co-authors with relevant knowledge on the specific topics. 
All major changes will remain open for at least three weeks to allow all co-authors to feedback. 
Every co-author can request a change to be reverted and request further discussion to reach a new consensus. 
Co-authors are encouraged to review GitHub activity periodically as co-authorship implies agreement with the content.  

### Examples

What is a small change:
- typos, language and formatting
- adding new sensor descriptions
- adding images

### What is a major change: 
- change of uncertainties ranges
- concrete suggestions i.e. related to correction of methods
