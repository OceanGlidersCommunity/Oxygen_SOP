## SOP development process

1) Initial SOP was drafted by [Patricia López-García](https://github.com/patricialg), [Tom Hull](https://github.com/tomhull), [Soeren Thomsen](https://github.com/soerenthomsen) and [Johannes Hahn](https://github.com/hahn-johannes).

2) Two expert sessions during OceanGliders Best Practice Workshop, May 11 - 25 2021. 
Additional authors joined: [Bastien Y. Queste](https://github.com/bastienqueste), [Gerd Krahmann](https://github.com/gkrahmann), [Charlotte Williams](https://github.com/charlotte-aj-williams), Mun Woo, Charitha Pattiaratchi, [Laurent Coppola](https://github.com/laurcopp), Tania Morales, [Virginie Racape](https://github.com/vracape), [Claire Gourcuff](https://github.com/cgourcuf), John Allen, Eva Alou, [Nikolaos D. Zarokanellos](https://github.com/nizaroka)

3) First community and user feedback was provided during the OceanGliders Best Practice Workshop, May 11 - 25 2021 by attendees. 

4) SOP moved to this repository by: [Patricia López-García](https://github.com/patricialg), [Tom Hull](https://github.com/tomhull), [Soeren Thomsen](https://github.com/soerenthomsen) and [Julius Busecke](https://github.com/jbusecke) in September 2021. 

5) Additional authors joined on GitHub prior to the community review: [Victor Turpin](https://github.com/vturpin), [Catherine Schmechtig](https://github.com/catsch), [Pierre Testor](https://github.com/ptestor), [Julius Busecke](https://github.com/jbusecke).

6) At the moment: 4 months community review on GitHub until 31 January 2022.

7) Additional authors joined on GitHub during the community review: [Evi Bourma](https://github.com/evibourma), [Clark Richards](https://github.com/richardsc), [Stuart Pearce](https://github.com/s-pearce)

## Contributions 

[Patricia López-García](https://github.com/patricialg) drafted the initial document collating information from several SOPs, sensor manuals and articles. 
Main contribution to: Introduction section (producing Table 1 from information gathered from glider users and completing information for Clark electrodes sensors SBE 43/63), Pre-deployment operations and calibrations section (subsections Storage and cleaning and Pre-deployment calibrations), Post-recovery operations and calibrations section. 
She added some images to the document. 
She co-chaired two oxygen expert sessions during the OceanGliders Best Practice workshop in May 2021. 
She implemented discussions and comments from expert sessions. 
She reviewed and edited all parts of the SOP. She helps to maintain the SOP on GitHub.
