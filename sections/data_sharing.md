# Data sharing

OceanGliders strongly encourages all glider operators to share their data to the public and provide open access both in real time and delayed mode. 
The best practices of data sharing are described in the [OceanGliders data management user manual](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/OG-format-user-manual).
