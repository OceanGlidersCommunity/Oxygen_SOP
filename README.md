## About Markdown and Pandoc

Hosting this document on GitHub allows easy editing by contributors, no need to pull the repository to your local machine.
However, [Github flavoured markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is missing some features which are nice to have in the final version of the document, most notably citations.
To add these features we use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and use Github actions to author a HTML and PDF version of the SOP.
