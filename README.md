8. All contributers will be listed as co-authors on the next peer-reviewed publication.

## Next steps
1) 4 months community review on GitHub until end of January 2022
3) Submission to [Frontiers: Research Topic Best Practices in Ocean Observing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7173/best-practices-in-ocean-observing) for peer-review
4) Depositing of major SOP releases at the [Ocean Best Practice System (OBPS)](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org)

The main SOP document will always reside in this GitHub repository to allow updates within the OceanGliders community at any time.

## About Markdown and Pandoc

Hosting this document on Github allows easy editing by contributors, no need to pull the repository to your local machine.
However, [Github flavoured markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is missing some features which are nice to have in the final version of the document, most notably citations.
To add these features we use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and use Github actions to author a HTML and PDF version of the SOP.
