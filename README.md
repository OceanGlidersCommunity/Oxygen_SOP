# OceanGliders Oxygen SOP

This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Oxygen_SOP) is for the [OceanGliders](https://www.oceangliders.org) Oxygen Standard Operating Procedure (SOP).

Read the SOP [here](https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/Oxygen_SOP/sections/authors_SOP_development_process.html). 
If you are reading a pdf or other offline version of this SOP, please click on this [link](https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/Oxygen_SOP/sections/authors_SOP_development_process.html) to read the most recent online version.

## Continous community review
Feedback by the global glider community is possible at any time. 
Everyone is welcome to join the SOP.

### Who is invited to review?
Constructive feedback by anyone is welcome. 
We encourage both experts and new gliders users who want to start observing oxygen to feedback on the document. 
For example: Experts are welcome to critically assess the specific methods and uncertainty ranges outlined in the SOP. 
New users can help to improve the SOP by providing a feedback from the user perspective. 
Please [let us know that you use the SOP](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Oxygen_SOP/discussions).

### How to contribute
See contributer guideline [here](https://github.com/OceanGlidersCommunity/Oxygen_SOP/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Next steps
1) Preparation of [GOOS](https://www.goosocean.org) endorsement as outline in [Hermes 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.25607/OBP-926)
2) Depositing of first major SOP release at the [Ocean Best Practice System (OBPS)](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org) + doi by OBPS.
3) Submission of shorter version to [Frontiers: Research Topic Best Practices in Ocean Observing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7173/best-practices-in-ocean-observing) for peer-review in spring 2022.

The main SOP document will always reside in this GitHub repository to allow updates within the OceanGliders community at any time. 
After major revisions regular updates are planned.
