# Post-recovery operations and calibrations

At first users should report that their mission is over to support(at)oceanobs.org

## Biofouling assessment
Pictures should be taken for biofuiling assessment. 

## Sensor storage
Foil must be kept wet and protected from light after recovery until validation in the lab.

## Lab calibration
When the glider is recovered, a 0% and 100% calibration is recommended as outlined above at two different temperatures levels.

## Field calibration
If you recover the glider from a small boat or a research vessel follow protocols described in {numref}`deployment_small_boat` and {numref}`deployment_ship_CTD` accordingly.
