# OBPS Metadata table (non-journal contribution)
Document Data Sheet v5 (for submissions to www.oceanbestpractices.net)

We recommend including this document data sheet into your Best Practice document. Please do not change any formatting, entries in the left column, or the table structure. The format below will allow automatic ingest of the data in this table into the OceanBestPractices Repository. Enter data only in the right-hand column.
Mandatory fields are indicated with ** but we strongly recommend that you provide data (if applicable) for all the metadata fields requested; this will allow you to unambiguously declare what your best practice is about and help our indexing technology make it more visible.
